## Data Types

There is meny data types in python, However I will only cover 4 of them.
* Strings

* integers

* Floating-Point Numbers (decimals)

* Boolean

You can test the type of some data using the `type()` function, below you can see
the output of doing this on diffrent data types.
```python
# strings
>>> type("I am a string.")
<class 'str'>


# intergers
>>> type(10)
<class 'int'>


# floats
>>> type(4.2)
<class 'float'>

# boolean
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
```

If you want to convert data to a diffrent type you can use the following functions.
Becareful though, you cant convert a sting like 'hello world' to and interger However
you can convert an integer like 555 to '555' using `str(555)`.

```python
# this converts an item to a string
str()

# this converts an item to a integer
int()

# this converts an item to a float
float()
```
